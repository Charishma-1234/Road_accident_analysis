# Road_accident_analysis
1. Project Title/ Headline
   A concise, descriptive name for the dashboard.

2. Short Description /  Project Goal
The primary goal of this dashboard is to transform raw road accident data into actionable insights. It aims to answer key questions such as:
• What are the trends in accidents and casualties over time?
• Which types of vehicles are most frequently involved in accidents?
• What are the differences in accidents between urban and rural areas?
• How do light conditions (day vs. dark) affect accident frequency?

3. Tech Stack
The following tools and technologies were used to develop this dashboard:
• Power BI Desktop: The main data visualization and report creation platform.
• Power Query: Used for data extraction, transformation, and cleaning.
• DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Employed for creating custom measures and calculated columns to derive deeper insights from the data.

4. Dashboard Visuals
The dashboard is designed with a clean and intuitive layout, featuring several key visuals:
• Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Displaying total accidents, total casualties, and different casualty severity levels (fatal, serious, slight) with year-over-year percentage changes.
• Casualties by Vehicle Type: A bar chart or treemap showing which vehicle types, such as cars, bikes, and buses, are most involved in accidents.
• Casualties by Month: A time-series chart illustrating the monthly trend of casualties over the past two years, allowing for easy comparison.
• Casualties by Urban/Rural Areas: A donut chart visualizing the distribution of casualties in urban versus rural locations.
• Casualties by Light Condition: Another donut chart showing the split of accidents between day and dark light conditions.
• Casualties by Road Type: A bar chart breaking down casualties by the type of road, such as dual carriageway or one-way street.
• Map Visualization: A map showing accident hotspots, providing a geographical overview of casualty locations.

5. Business Impact & Insights
This dashboard provides significant value by:
• Identifying High-Risk Areas: The map and urban/rural breakdown help pinpoint specific locations or environments where accidents are more common.
• Targeting Safety Campaigns: Insights into the most affected vehicle types and road conditions can guide the development of targeted safety campaigns and public awareness programs.
• Informing Policy Decisions: The trend analysis and breakdown by casualty severity can help authorities allocate resources effectively and measure the impact of new safety policies.
